<hr>

Welcome to my page! My name is I-Da Chiang (江宜達). I will soon become a postdoc fellow at the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica (ASIAA) working with Dr. Hiroyuki Hirashita. I got my PhD in astrophysics (well, officailly just physics) at the Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences (CASS), University of California San Diego (UCSD). I am a member of <a href="http://karinsandstrom.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Karin Sandstrom</a>'s nearby galaxy research group.
