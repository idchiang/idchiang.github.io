### About me
Welcome to my webpage! My name is I-Da Chiang, and I am a PhD student at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in the [Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences (CASS)](http://cass.ucsd.edu/index.php/Main_Page). I am a member of [Prof. Karin Sandstrom](http://karinsandstrom.github.io/)'s [nearby galaxies group](https://nearbygalaxies.github.io/).

My research focuses on the study of **intersteller dust properties** of **nearby galaxies**, and how the dust properties relate to local properties like **gas surface density**, **H<sub>2</sub>-to-CO conversion factor**, **dust-to-gas ratio**, and **metallicity**. I am also interested in techniques of fitting dust surface density from Far-infrared (FIR) emission maps.
