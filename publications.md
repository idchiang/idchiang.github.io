### Selected publications
Here are my selected first- or second-author publications:

+ I-Da Chiang et al., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201110561C/abstract" target="_blank">“Resolving the Dust-to-Metals Ratio and CO-to-H<sub>2</sub> Conversion Factor in the Nearby Universe”</a>, 2020, arXiv:2011.10561, *accepted by ApJ*.

    I study the resolved dust-to-metals ratio (D/M) and the CO-to-H<sub>2</sub> conversion factor in five nearby galaxies: IC342, M31, M33, M101 and NGC628. I foudn that the D/M is sensitive to the adopted conversion factor. To get a reasonable D/M, one needs a conversion factor parameterized by not only metallicity. I also proposed a novel method to constrain D/M and the CO-to-H<sub>2</sub> conversion factor simultaneously.

+ Dyas Utomo & I-Da Chiang et al., <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190208629" target="_blank">"The Resolved Distributions of Dust Mass and Temperature in Local Group Galaxies"</a>, 2019, ApJ, 874, 141.

    We utilize the far-infrared observation from Herschel observatory to derive the dust properties in the local group galaxies. We show that the unresolved studies could possibly overestimate the dust temperature and underestimate the overall dust surface density.

+ I-Da Chiang et al., <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...865..117C" target="_blank">“The SpatiallyResolved Dust-to-metals Ratio in M101”</a>, 2018, ApJ, 865, 117.

    I use the modified blackbody model and archival multi-wavelnght observation to show that the dust-to metals ratio in M101 is not constant. The varying dust-to-metals ratio in M101 is highly correlated to the molecular hydrogen fraction.
