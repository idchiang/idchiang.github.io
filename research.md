### Research interest
I am interested in the relations between *dust, metal, and neutral gas* in the interstellar medium (ISNM) of
*nearby galaxies*, especially how these relations depend on local physical environments. I am also intertested in *SED fitting techniques* and *radio astronomy* in general.

### Projects
+ Dust-to-Metals Ratio in Nearby galaxies

    Dust-to-Metals Ratio (D/M) provides keen insights into dust chemical evolution. I measure how the D/M evolves with the local enviroinment in the ISM from archival and new observations. In the first phase of this project, I built the dust-fitting techniques in one single galaxy with large metallicity gradient, M101 (Chiang et al. 2018). In the second phase, I push the study to more nearby galaxies with "direct" metallicity measurements, and derives an empirical formula for the spatially resolved D/M (Chiang et al. in prep.).

+ Dust Properties in the Local Group

    As you might already notice, I love nearby galaxies, and so do my colleagues. We fit the dust properties in four Local Group galaxies and study how dust mass and temperature varies within and across galaxies. We found that when we degrade the reoslution to mimic distant galaxies, we tend to get a warmer mass-weighted temperature (Utomo & Chiang et al. 2019). We also study the spatial power spectra of these maps, and find a single power-law and point source component fits well to our data. This suggests that the spatial power spectrum does not constrain the disc scale height (Koch & Chiang et al. 2020).
