### Research interest
I am interested in the relations between *dust, metal, and neutral gas* in the interstellar medium (ISNM) of
*nearby galaxies*, especially how these relations depend on local physical environments. I am also intertested in *SED fitting techniques* and *radio astronomy* in general.

### Projects
+ Dust-to-Metals Ratio in Nearby galaxies

    Dust-to-Metals Ratio (D/M) provides keen insights into dust chemical evolution. I measure how the D/M evolves with the local enviroinment in the ISM from archival and new observations. In the first phase of this project, I built the dust-fitting techniques in one single galaxy with large metallicity gradient, M101 (Chiang et al. 2018). In the second phase, I push the study to more nearby galaxies with "direct" metallicity measurements, and derives an empirical formula for the spatially resolved D/M (Chiang et al. in prep.).

    As you might already notice, I love nearby galaxies, and so do my colleagues.
