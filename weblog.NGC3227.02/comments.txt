QA feedback from NRAO staff:


One of your Scheduling Blocks, , has been processed through the VLA
CASA Calibration Pipeline, which is designed to handle Stokes I
continuum data, and has received a QA2 score of . NRAO staff have
checked the calibrated data and no major issues have been identified.
Some data may need further flagging before imaging as described below:



- If your science involves spectral lines, you should be aware of the following:

1) The pipeline applies Hanning-smoothing by default, which may make the
   calibrated data set not optimal for certain spectral-line science.

2) During the calibration process, several edge channels in each sub
   band get flagged by default because they are noisier. Therefore,
   breaks in the frequency span get introduced in the pipeline
   calibrated data, which in turn may make the output not suitable
   for certain spectral-line science.

3) The pipeline runs an RFI flagging algorithm which should flag strong
   lines and may remove spectral lines of interest to your science.


- If your observations used a resolved calibrator source (i.e., has UV
  limits) but does not have standard model images in CASA, the calibrated
  data through the pipeline would not be accurate. In such instances,
  re-calibration using UV limits, or imaging the calibrator first and
  using the resulting image model, will be needed.
